Description:
This project is inteded to create a desktop application software that will allow users to add an item of their choice while also specifying the category and expiration date of the item, if necessary. From a software perspective, users will get to decide if they want to add more items, and should they say no, the software will display a menu that will ask if the user wishes to view the list of items, add another item, or remove an item. If the user wants to see the item list, they should be able to filter the list either by alphabetical order, category (In which case repeated categories will be counted as one category), or expiration date. The choice will be up to the user. But the software is not the only back-end side of this application, as this application features a database that will store a user's name, login information, and the items they have entered. As for the front-end persepctive, the interface will allow users to create an account using 2-Factor Authentication, and it will also provide users with a concise view of the items they have added.

Materials Used:
The software for this application is being coded via Python. The database that will store user information and items is being created via MongoDB. The front-end will be created utilizing HTML/JavaScript/Flask (Edit this).
